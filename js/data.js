Little did I know that the liquor store stood because my dad among other Koreans living in Los Angeles, acquired rifles and stood guard on the rooftop to deter looters. The lives that were lost in the riots were senseless. The Los Angeles Times gathered data including stories of who each person was and how they lost their lives. A memorial is usually created with the names of the honorable who died defending our country or in a tragic event that marks history. I created this visualization in order to memorialize the events, as well as the names of those who died as a means of symbolizing an ongoing tension of power relationships and race relations that still go unresolved. The sense of injustice is what ingnited the city, while little was done to absolve or resolve any of it. It's easy to forget this event when everything is seemingly normal today, but there still lies a growing tension that should not be ignored.
